Project 4 - Web Automation via Cypress

Overview:
I wrote a test script that focuses on the user experience by testing the critical functions and elements of an e-commerce website. 
The website I chose to use for this project is https://automationexercise.com/. I chose this website because it is a publicly accessible website for automation testing practice.

Instructions:
You will need VS Code or another script-reading platform and Cypress.
There are 8 test scripts in total. They are independent from one another and can be tested in any order.
Run tests in Cypress. I have noted various steps or outcomes as comments in the scripts.

Summary:
Each test script focused on webpage elements the user would need to move from one step to the next in the shopping experience. 
Tasks included: adding to cart, removing from cart, searching, order submission, and invalid searches.

I tried to keep each task and script as simple as possible, but also account for other factors. I wanted to verify that the website would provide the user a pleasant experience.
I added basic logical steps as well as verification of popups and page information. 
Sometimes, I would test for certain outputs, knowing the test would fail. This was done with the user in mind and knowing that the website needed some adjustments in the code.

The primary challenge I faced during this project was my lack of in-depth and detailed testing code. I am still learning all possible ways to test, but this was a fun project to pratice what I know and explore more.
